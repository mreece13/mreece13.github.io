::: {#hero-heading}

Hi, I’m Mason Reece, and I’m a PhD student in MIT’s Political Science department focusing on American Politics and Models & Methods. I am interested in better understanding how election systems impact voter participation and confidence in our democratic system so that this knowledge can inform advocacy and directly improve electoral administration. To bring a practical lens to my research, I have served as the lead poll worker in Houston and Cambridge and organized a youth voters conference. In my free time, I love riding my bike, hiking, and trying food from around the world.
